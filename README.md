# BOB Program Data Preparation (TMC Orgs)

## General Process  

**Note:**  
Throughout the process below, please maintain a notes document to log any areas where data is unclear, assumptions are made, discrepancies are identified, or additional clarification from others may be needed. This log will ensure transparency and facilitate follow-up discussions, which you should initiate *along the way* to address unresolved issues.

## 1. Categorize Datasets  

For each organization assigned to you during the inventory stage, clearly categorize the datasets into one of the following program types:  
- **Organizing**  
- **Voter Contact**  
   - Door-to-Door  
   - Phone-Banking  
   - Relational  
- **Other** - Include a description of the dataset

## 2. Standardize Datasets  

Reference the program type assignment below:  
- **Organizing**: Tianyi  
- **Voter Contact**:  
   - Door-to-Door: Michael  
   - Phone-Banking: Michael  
   - Relational: Matt  

For each assigned program type:  
1. **Review the Analysis Plan**  
2. **Develop Data Models/Schemas**
3. **Review the relevant materials from the inventory (i.e., data outlines or codebooks)**
4. **Create and document standardized data models or schemas to align datasets with the analysis goals**
5. **Each schema should define:**
- Required fields for analysis vs. optional fields.  
- Standardized field names.  
- Desired data formats or types.  
- Coding schemes for variables.  
6. **Get Michaelâ€™s peer review of the schema, revise as needed, and then share it with Miya for approval.**
**If timelines are tight, these reviews can proceed in parallel. This step can also proceed in parallel with the next phase.**

## 3. Apply the Data Models/Schemas  

- Create new datasets by transforming raw data.  
- Validate the datasets to confirm they meet schema requirements.

## Next Steps  
- Log unresolved issues.  
- Follow up as needed.  
- Document all steps for transparency.
